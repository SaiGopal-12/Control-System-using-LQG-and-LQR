# Aircraft Control System Simulation (LQR, LQG, Kalman Filter)

This repository contains MATLAB and Python implementations for designing, simulating, and analyzing control systems for an aircraft‚Äôs longitudinal (pitch) and lateral (sideslip, roll) dynamics.

The project demonstrates how Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) and Linear Quadratic Gaussian (LQG) controllers improve stability and performance compared to open-loop dynamics. A Kalman Filter is also implemented to show optimal state estimation under measurement noise.

## üìê System Models

### 1. Longitudinal Dynamics (Pitch Control)
State vector:
x = [w, q, Œ∏] = [Vertical Velocity, Pitch Rate, Pitch Angle]

System matrices:
A = [[-0.3149, 235.8928, 0], [-0.0034, -0.4282, 0], [0, 1, 0]]
B = [[-5.5079], [0.0021], [0]]
C = [[0, 0, 1]]

### 2. Lateral Dynamics (Sideslip & Roll Control)
State vector:
x = [Œ≤, p, r, œÜ] = [Sideslip Angle, Roll Rate, Yaw Rate, Roll Angle]

System matrices:
A = [[-0.0558, -0.9968, 0.0802, 0.0415],
     [0.5980, -0.1150, -0.0318, 0],
     [-3.0500, 0.3880, -0.4650, 0],
     [0, 0.0805, 1, 0]]
B = [[0.0729, 0], [-4.75, 0.00775], [0.1530, 0.1430], [0, 0]]
C = [[1, 0, 0, 0], [0, 0, 0, 1]]
